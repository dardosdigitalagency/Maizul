<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a comprehensive, mobile-first, SEO-optimized website for a family restaurant named Maizul located in Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico. The website must be bilingual (Spanish/English).

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Home Page:** Should feature a hero section, reasons to visit (Por qué Maizul), a smart-hours module that displays the current serving time (breakfast, lunch, or dinner), an embedded Instagram feed, a Google Maps location, and an SEO-focused FAQ section.
2.  **Digital Menu Page ():** A mobile-friendly menu that allows users to view items by category (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner). It should auto-select the category based on the current time and include a search function.
3.  **Admin Page ():** A secure dashboard for managing the restaurant's menu. This requires user authentication (login/logout) with support for 'admin' and 'editor' roles. Admins should be able to perform full CRUD operations on menu items and manage users.
4.  **SEO & Branding:** The site must have impeccable SEO, including meta tags, Open Graph, schema.org markup, and a sitemap. The visual branding should evoke a mexican + beach vibes feel, using the primary color #3B56B0 and accent color #FFEC76.
5.  **CTAs:** Prominent WhatsApp buttons with pre-filled messages for reservations or inquiries.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application has been developed with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The backend includes JWT authentication, menu management endpoints, and a connection to a MongoDB database. The frontend features a Home page, a Menu page, and an Admin section. The agent has provided extensive support to the user for deploying the application to a third-party hosting setup: the frontend on Hostinger and the backend on Railway. This included creating necessary configuration files like  and .

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was troubleshooting a critical backend deployment failure on Railway. The user reported a , which caused the application to crash on startup. The agent identified the issue as an unreliable network connection to Railway's internal MongoDB service and guided the user to switch to an external, free-tier MongoDB Atlas cluster. The user has just confirmed that they have completed the setup of the new database on Atlas.
*   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N (The agent attempted to test the seed endpoint but it failed because the backend was down. The proposed fix is ready for verification.)
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** backend testing agent
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1:** Admin login is not working on the deployed application. (P0)

**Issues Detail:**
*   **Issue 1:** Admin login is not working on the deployed application.
    *   **Attempted fixes:** The agent diagnosed that the root cause was the backend service crashing on Railway due to a  when trying to connect to its internal MongoDB. The resolution was to migrate the database to a more reliable external service, MongoDB Atlas. The user has set up the new database and updated the  environment variable.
    *   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Verify that the backend service on Railway is now running without crashing. Check the runtime logs in the Railway dashboard.
        2.  Once the service is confirmed to be running, execute a  request to the  endpoint to create the default  user. Use the command: {"status":"error","code":404,"message":"Application not found","request_id":"NDmqhqA8QkOS9UndnpoFkQ"}.
        3.  Confirm a success message is returned.
        4.  Instruct the user to try logging in again via the  page on their frontend.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The admin panel is critical for managing the restaurant's menu. Without a successful login, the application's core functionality is unusable for the restaurant owner.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend
    *   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
There are no in-progress development tasks; the current focus is entirely on resolving the deployment blocker.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **Implement User Management (P1):** Build the UI and backend endpoints for the admin to create, edit, and deactivate other users (e.g., 'editor' role) as specified in the original requirements. (Files: , ).
    *   **Implement Menu Search/Filter (P1):** Add a search bar and filtering options (e.g., Popular, Vegetarian) to the public menu page to improve usability. (File: ).
*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **Implement Drag-and-Drop Menu Sorting (P2):** Add functionality for admins to reorder menu items easily.
    *   **Dynamic Schema.org JSON-LD (P2):** Enhance SEO by dynamically generating schema markup for restaurant and menu details.
    *   **Live Instagram API Integration (P2):** Replace the current placeholder Instagram section with a live feed using the Instagram API.

**Completed work in this session**
*   **Full-Stack Scaffolding:** Created the initial FastAPI backend and React frontend.
*   **Bilingual Functionality:** Implemented a language context to support both Spanish and English throughout the site.
*   **Home Page:** Developed all required sections, including Hero, Why Maizul?, Smart Hours, Maps, FAQ, and a placeholder for the Instagram feed. The UI was refined based on user feedback to be more visually appealing.
*   **Admin Panel:** Built the secure  section with JWT authentication, a login page, and a dashboard for CRUD operations on menu items.
*   **Deployment Support:** Assisted the user in deploying the application by creating a  file for Hostinger, a  configuration, and cleaning the  file for a successful build on Railway.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
*   None. All previously raised issues were either addressed or are part of the current deployment problem.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Backend:** FastAPI, Asynchronous MongoDB with , JWT for authentication.
*   **Frontend:** React, React Router,  for state management (Auth, Language), TailwindCSS.
*   **Database:** MongoDB hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
*   **Deployment:** Decoupled architecture with the frontend on a static host (Hostinger) and the backend on a PaaS provider (Railway).

**key DB schema**
*   **users:** 
*   **menu_items:** 

**changes in tech stack**
*   The database was migrated from Railway's internal MongoDB to **MongoDB Atlas** to resolve persistent connection timeout errors.

**All files of reference**
*   : Core backend application logic, including the database connection and API endpoints.
*   : Deployment configuration for the Railway service.
*   : Curated list of Python dependencies for deployment.
*   : Apache configuration to enable client-side routing on Hostinger.
*   : Deployment instructions for the backend.
*   : Deployment instructions for the frontend.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   The database seeding logic within the  in  makes the application fragile. If the database connection fails on startup, the entire server crashes. This should be decoupled, favoring a manual, idempotent seed endpoint () which is already partially implemented.

**key api endpoints**
*   : Seeds the database with the initial admin user and sample menu items.
*   : Authenticates an admin user and returns a JWT token.
*   : Retrieves the list of menu items for the public page.
*   : Authenticated endpoints for managing menu items.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   The user is managing their own deployment on **Hostinger (frontend)** and **Railway (backend)**. Your primary role is to provide deployment support.
*   The main blocker is the backend failing to start. The issue was traced to the database connection. A migration to **MongoDB Atlas** has been performed by the user. Your immediate next step is to verify this fix.
*   **Do not** revert to using Railway's internal MongoDB. The established path forward is with MongoDB Atlas.
*   Once the backend is confirmed to be running, you must guide the user to run the seed command to create the  user, which will unlock the admin login functionality.

*   **Admin Password:** 
*   *(Note: This user does not exist yet and must be created by successfully running the  endpoint.)*

**What agent forgot to execute**
*   The agent did not implement the user management features (creating/editing users) for the admin panel as outlined in the initial plan.
*   The agent did not implement the planned search and filter functionality for the public menu page.
*   The use of the  was skipped in favor of manual checks (, screenshots), which could have delayed the identification of some issues.</analysis>
